- [ ] line 162: should only add rescindee to queue if rescind was successful (ie. rescindee was snot in CS)
    - update on on ^ : check if still necessary or naaah...
- [ ] something wrong with queueing
    - [ ] need to remove node that enters CS from everyone's queue
        - update on ^ : check if fixed
